          A lot of things we've been doing have fallen through due to 1 thing:
          <em>not planning shit out.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          So, this new year, lets start planning shit out on the forums for our
          events and servers. The community's weekly Town Hall will be where all
          our plans discussed on the forums finalized. Do not come to Town Hall
          unprepared.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lets say you wanted to create an event for the community. You go to and
          take care of all the details with Moderators. They will after all be the
          ones posting your Steam event and announcements, and because of that they'll
          be asking you general questions in order to properly post them:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>What are you doing?</li>
            <li>How long is it?</li>
            <li>^^^ lots of details to plan out a smooth event.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>
          Mods can help you with promoting your event, but count more on making an
          announcement during Town Hall for an audiance. Not all, but most events
          with more than 10 people are offically announced and posted at Town Hall.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for any event that needs a server, there are 3 options:
          <ol>
            <li>Make it yourself.</li>
            <li>Have someone else make it.</li>
            <li>Or just hijack someone's server for a day.</li>
          </ol>
          I've actually found out that option 3 is a lot of fun when you're talking
          with the owner of a server and you're saying "Hey, I want to host an event
          on your server. Would that be cool with you?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Then they're all like
          "SHEEIIIT MAN, YOU WANT TO HOST AN EVENT ON MY LITTLE 'OL SERVER NOW? :DD"
        </p>
        <p>
          It can make people feel pretty important and happy. (if you know it clap your hands)

            Christmas Gifting Event is being hosted on December 22nd, 2015.

            Go around different games and invite any friends you'd like to invite.
            We want to gift games to people because we can populate the Discord chat
            as well as give something back for all the taking we do. If you're wondering
            what or how many games we got, <a href="http://tinyurl.com/z3lw9zx">
                check this out.

            2016 Plans now have a deadline of June 11th. That's
            the 6 month mark, a reasonable date to have everything done by.
            Best to have a deadline when things should be done then not have one at all.
        <div id="list">
            <ul>
                <li>CS:GO Workshop server is up @ 192.99.3.118:27015</br>
                The server is loading up, maps are downloading fast, and the whole server
                works as smoothly as it did on the previous box. Pretty soon we'll have
                some events set up for the server, and
                I'm looking for people who'd like to help organize them. Contact me anyway
                you want. (Steam, email contact, forums, discord...)</li>
                <li>Gmod DarkRP... yea this one is gonna take a WHILE. So I'm gonna come
                back with the next update as to a clear team of who is running it.
                It's the first thing that should get done. Right now I have
                one guy and that's VLFire. I help occasionally, but I'm talking about
                finding real admins who can develop ad create the server.
                (backend stuff with plugins and configs)</li>
                <li>Our Minecraft Factions server. So far no updates from Zellous yet
                (he's the guy running it) as to when it'll be back up. We'll just have to
                wait patiently until things get done. I'm thinking it'll be up before
                Christmas though.</li>
            </ul>

            BTW, today is Friday, so that should mean I'm hosting Planetside Fridays right?
            I moved this Planetside Friday to Saturday because of new "real life" plans.
            It's the holidays, and I'm busy, and I'm hosting the damn event. If anyone
            would like to take up running this Friday's platoon go on right ahead! Then
            tell me who you are you magical unicorn.
